# SME Helper
 Above are a bunch of files that you can use when studying and taking the SME Test.

## How to use GitHub
You can click on each file to preview them, but you have to download them to have full functionality (searching text, playing the practice game, etc). You can download all the files by clicking on "<> Code ↓" and clicking on "Download ZIP". To download individual files, click on the file you want, and then click "Download raw file" or the download icon.

## What are the different files?
### Files to study beforehand:
* [The Study Guide](https://github.com/4ecretman/SME-Helper/blob/main/SME%20CAM-F%20Study%20Guide.pdf) is there to point out the main areas you need to study.
* [The Practice Game](https://github.com/4ecretman/SME-Helper/blob/main/SME%20CAM-F%20Study%20Game.html) is a simple multiple choice practice test that changes the questions every time you refresh the tab. 
* [The Brief](https://github.com/4ecretman/SME-Helper/blob/main/SME%20Brief.pdf) has some of the main info that you will need on the test. If you don't know something on the study guide, it will probably be answered here.
